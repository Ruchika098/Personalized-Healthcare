Personalized Healthcare for Women â€“ A Data-Driven Approach

Women have diverse health needs that are often not adequately addressed by generic 
healthcare solutions. A one-size-fits-all approach leads to suboptimal health outcomes, 
limited access to relevant services, and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. 
Personalization in healthcare can bridge this gap by considering individual health profiles, 
preferences, and risk factors. 

The goal of this project is to develop a data-driven solution using Hierarchical Clustering 
and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to segment women based on health-related 
attributes. These segments will help in providing personalized healthcare 
recommendations, improving accessibility, and enhancing health outcomes.
